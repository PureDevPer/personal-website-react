I am a software engineer based in the United States.

I'm interested in all aspects of software development. Recently, my passion lies in the web application development including both the front end and the back end. I fell in love with the modern JavaScript.

Since I was a senior in college, I've liked mobile wireless networks as well. Therefore, I have read new telecommunication technologies such as next generation wireless networks.
