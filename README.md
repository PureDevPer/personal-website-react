I am a software engineer based in the United States.

I'm interested in all aspects of software development. Recently, my passion lies in the web application development including both the front end and the back end.

Since I was a senior in college, I've liked mobile wireless networks as well. Therefore, I have read new telecommunication technologies such as next generation wireless networks.
